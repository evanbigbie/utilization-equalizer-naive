# utilization-equalizer-naive

<p>Naive implementation of C++ program to pay multiple credit cards down to same utilization percentage, or as close as possible, given the respective card limits/balances and the amount the user is currently able to pay.</p>

<p>At this time there are only options for 4 cards with hard coded names. This is an artifact of my having created this logic for personal use. Future versions will allow user defined card quantity and names.</p>

<p>The naive implementation is a result of my desire to personally use this program for paying my own cards, which I needed to use ASAP. If it exists yet, please see 'utilization-equalizer-DRY' for a more optimized implementation.</p>
